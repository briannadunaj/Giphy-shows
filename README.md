# Giphy API

This web page will populate gifs of your choice. 

When the user clicks on a button, the page will grab 10 static, non-animated gif images from the GIPHY API and place them on the page.

When the user clicks one of the still GIPHY images, the gif will animate. If the user clicks the gif again, it will stop playing.

Every gif has its rating listed above it.

The submit form will create a button with the value from the user input box and add it next to the pre-existing buttons.
